            <h2>Python Introduction</h2>

            <h2>What is Python?</h2>

            <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development,
                as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and
                packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
                <br>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input
                will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection
                of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the
                other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.<br> Python is a popular programming language. It was created
                by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.</p>
            <h2>Who manages Python Today?</h2>

            <p>From version 2.1 onwards, Python is managed by Python Software Foundation situated in Delaware, USA It is a non-profit organization devoted to the growth and enhancement of Python language. Their website is http://www.python.org .</p>
            <h2>What can Python do?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
                <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
                <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
                <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
                <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Why Python?</h2>
            Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).<br> • Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.<br> • Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other
            programming languages.
            <br> • Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.<br> • Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional
            way.
            <br> There are numerous examples of popular, high-load websites/webapps that have been developed using Python. Here are some of the most popular of them:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>NASA</li>
                <li>Instagram</li>
                <li>Mozilla</li>
                <li>Spotify</li>
                <li>Reddit</li>
                <li>Dropbox</li>
                <li>And above all youtube</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Features of Python</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Simple</li>
                Python is easy to use, powerful, and versatile, making it a great choice for beginners and experts alike. Python's readability makes it a great first programming language — it allows you to think like a programmer and not waste time with confusing syntax.
                <li>Dynamically typed</li>
                Python don't have any problem even if we don't declare the type of variable. It states the kind of variable in the runtime of the program. Python also take cares of the memory management which is crucial in programming. So, Python is a dynamically typed
                language.
                <li>Robust</li>
                Python has very strict rules which every program must compulsorily follow and if these rules are violated then Python terminates the code by generating “Exception”
                <li>Supports multiple programming paradigms</li>
                It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library. Python supports
                both procedure-oriented and object-oriented programming which is one of the key python features.
                <li>Compiled as well as interpreted</li>
                In various books of python programming, it is mentioned that pythonlanguage is interpreted. But that is half correct the python program is first compiled and then interpreted. The compilation part is hidden from the programmer thus, many programmers believe
                that it is an interpreted language. The compilation part is done first when we execute our code and this will generate byte code and internally this byte code gets converted by the python virtual machine(p.v.m) according to the underlying
                platform(machine+operating system).
                <li>Cross Platform</li>
                Python is a cross-platform language: a Python program written on a Macintosh computer will run on a Linux system and vice versa. Python programs can run on Windows computer, as long as the Windows machine has the Python interpreter installed (most other
                operating systems come with Python pre-installed).
                <li>Extensible</li>
                Python allows us to call C/C++/Java code from a Python code and thus we say it is an extensible language. We generally use this feature when we need a critical piece of code to run very fast . So we can code that part of our program in C or C++ and then
                use it from our Python program
                <li>Huge library</li>
                The Python Standard Library is huge indeed. It can help you do various things like Database Programming , E-mailing ,GUI Programming etc
            </ol>
